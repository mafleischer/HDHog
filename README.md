Browse a folder, list files and subfolders **sorted by size accross the directory tree** so that you see the biggest first.

## About <a name="about"></a>
One motivation for this tool was to conveniently find big disk space consumers in a folder and
delete them. To my surprise, there is not really something free out there for this task.


Only tested under Linux (Ubuntu) so far, but since all file operations are written generically, theoretically it should work for all OSes that that Python supports and that have Tk, though.

## Notes <a name="notes"></a>
- Symlinks are ignored and are not displayed for now
- At first, focus was only on finding and listing files. The tree view is really not optimal but sufficient for now
